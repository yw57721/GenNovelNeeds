# GenNovelNeeds
This repository contains the data and code for the project of generating novel customer needs.

-----------------------------------
This file "GPT3.5_generated needs.xlsx" contains the "novel" needs generated by GPT3.5 (text-davinci-003). Although GPT4 was recently released, it focuses on multimodal input. To the best of our knowledge, GPT4 still lacks the knowledge in marketing dynamics and human behaviour, and thus falls short in generating novel needs in a specific domain. The typical problems of GPT generated "novel" needs are as follows:

1. without novel content

Examples:

"A computer capable of facial recognition login",
"A computer capable of storing large amounts of data",
"A computer designed specifically for gaming",
"A computer equipped with a webcam for video conferencing"

2. irrelevant to customer needs

Examples:

"A computer recycling program to encourage customers to donate their old computers for discounts",
“A computer software environment that supports multiple programming languages",
”A cloud engineer who needs a laptop with cloud development tools and resources pre-installed"

3. vague
Examples:

"A computer tailored to a specific user's needs",
"A computer that can connect to a G network"
